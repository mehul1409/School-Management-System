# School Management System

This is a simple School Management System implemented in Java. The system manages teachers, students, and their fees while also allowing salary management for teachers. The main components of the system include classes for `Teacher`, `Student`, and `School`, which together simulate a basic school management system.

## Features

- **Teacher Management**: Add teachers, assign salaries, and track total salary payments.
- **Student Management**: Add students, track grades, and manage fees.
- **Salary Management**: Pay teachers' salaries and update total money spent by the school.
- **Fees Payment**: Students can pay fees, and the total money earned by the school is updated accordingly.

## Structure

The project contains the following classes:

1. **Main Class**
   - This is the entry point for the application. It creates teacher and student objects, manages school finances, and handles salary payments.
   
2. **Teacher Class**
   - Represents a teacher with an ID, name, salary, and the total salary earned. It also contains methods to pay salaries and update the school's total money spent.

3. **Student Class**

4. **School Class**
   - Manages the collection of teachers and students. It handles the money earned and spent by the school.
